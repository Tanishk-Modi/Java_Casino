Overview
--------

The Java Console Casino is a text-based gambling application that allows players to engage in classic casino games. Starting with a configurable balance, players can bet their money on various games, each offering different challenges and payout schemes. The objective is to stay in the game as long as possible without going bankrupt.

Programming Concepts Used
-------------------------

This project demonstrates the following Java programming skills:

### Core Concepts:

-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

    -   Use of **classes** and **interfaces** (e.g., `Game` interface, `Player`, `Roulette`, etc.).

    -   Encapsulation and abstraction for managing game logic.

-   **Inheritance and Polymorphism**:

    -   Implementation of different games inheriting from the `Game` interface.

### Java Essentials:

-   **Collections**: Use of data structures like `ArrayList` to handle deck management in card games.

-   **Randomization**: Leveraging `Random` for generating outcomes (e.g., card draws, slot spins, roulette wheel).

-   **Input Handling**: Using `Scanner` to manage user input and validation.

-   **Control Flow**: Extensive use of loops and conditionals to manage game states.

### Advanced Features:

-   **Custom Logic**: Designing payout systems and win conditions for each game.

-   **Error Handling**: Preventing invalid bets and ensuring smooth gameplay.

-   **Separation of Concerns**: Modular design with distinct classes for each game.

Future Improvements
-------------------

Here are some ideas for expanding this project:

-   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Transition from console-based gameplay to a graphical interface using JavaFX or Swing.

-   **Additional Games**: Include more casino games like Poker.

-   **Enhanced Visuals**: Add ASCII art or animations for a more immersive experience.
